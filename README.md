## Quick Start

1. Install the latest version of Angular cli

   ```sh
   yarn global add @angular/cli
   ```

2. Create a new Angular project
   ```sh
   ng new hello-world --defaults
   cd hello-world
   ```
3. Add `@jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy` to your project

   ```sh
   ng add @jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy
   ```

4. You will be prompted for a couple of questions:
   1. Your AWS Region
   2. The bucket you would like the files to be uploaded.
   3. The folder where the files should be uploaded (optional)
5. By default we will add the configuration for production setup.
6. After these steps your `angular.json` is updated with a new builder:
   ```json
   "deploy": {
       "builder": "@jefiozie/ngx-aws-deploy:deploy",
       "options": {}
   }
   ```
7. Run `ng deploy` to deploy your application to Amazon S3.

## Security üîë

Keep in mind that **with the default config, everybody that has access to the angular.json will have your aws secret**.
If you want more security, you can also use environment variable with `NG_DEPLOY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `NG_DEPLOY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `NG_DEPLOY_AWS_BUCKET` and `NG_DEPLOY_AWS_REGION`.
